🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based designed to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical information. The  uses a trained model and a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

🧠 Overview

This is a simple machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on 8 input features like Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Age, etc. It uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

⚙️How It Works

1. The model is trained on historical data using Logistic Regression.
2.This project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.
3.Users can run the notebook cells to train the model and test predictions.
4. The model predicts whether the user is diabetic or not.
